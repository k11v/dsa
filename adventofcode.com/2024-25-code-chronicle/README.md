Time to solve:

- read: 6m 0s
- think of O(n + 6^5) solution: 19m 52s
- think of brute force: 7s
- code: 17m 42s
- check and fix: 1m 38s
- run and fix CE: 33s
- success: 14s
- read: 2m 33s
- _total without part 2: 48m 39s_

Notes:

- For part 1 I had an idea for a faster algorithm that would have constant memory complexity and linear time complexity but for given input size it would be an overkill. Also it would be tricker to implement, so to see if it was worth implementing or not, I decided to quickly solve part 1 and check what part 2 was about.
- Even though I wanted to attempt part 2 of the puzzle on the day it was released, it remained locked because I hadn't collected all the necessary stars yet.
