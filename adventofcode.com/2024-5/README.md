Time to solve:

- read: 4m 35s
- think of O(n+m*k^2) time solution: 10m 51s
- think of O(n+m*k) time solution: 7m 47s
- drop thought: 10m 55s
- code: 15m 6s
- check and fix: 3m 7s
- run and fix: 56s
- run and fix: 1m 58s
- success: 25s
- read: 1m 24s
- _total without part 2: 57m 4s_

Notes:

- Part 1 could likely be solved faster.
